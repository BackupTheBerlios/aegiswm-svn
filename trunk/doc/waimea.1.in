.SH DESCRIPTION

Waimea is a highly customizable window manager for the X Window system 
conforming to the latest EWMH specification. Waimea supports multiple
virtual desktops and by using the cairo graphics library for all
rendering, waimea provides a modern vector-based style engine that
takes advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (through 
the X Render Extension).


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "--display DISPLAYNAME"
X server to contact

.TP
.B "--rcfile RESOURCEFILE"

.TP
.B "--help"

.P
Every setting avaiable in the

have an eqvivalent command line option that will override the
setting in the 
.B RESOURCE FILE.


.SH "RESOURCE FILE"
When starting, waimea looks for a  
.I .waimearc 
resource file in the users home directory. If file doesn't exist, waimea 
falls back to 
.I @pkgdatadir@/waimearc, 
the system wide configuration file. To force waimea to read a different
configuration file use 
.I --rcfile
switch. Below is a list of configuration options that waimea understands.

.TP
.B  screenMask:     List of screen numbers
Whitespace separated list of screens that waimea should manage. 
If you for example want waimea to handle only screen .0 and 
screen .2, then screenMask should be: '0 2'.
Option '--screen-mask' will override this setting.

.TP
.B scriptDir:     Dirpath
Path to alternate scripts directory
instead of
.IR @pkgdatadir@/scripts.
.I scriptDir 
is added to the PATH environment variable so that executables
in this directory can be called without directory path within
waimea.
Option '--script-dir' will override this setting.

.TP
.B doubleClickInterval:     Integer
Adjust the delay (in milliseconds) between mouse clicks for waimea
to consider it a double click. Default value is 
.I 300.
Option '--double-click' will override this setting.

.TP
.B clientSideRendering:     Boolean
Force waimea to use client side rendering of all graphics.
Option '--client-side' will override this setting.

.TP
.B renderingThreads:     Integer
Number of threads to use for rendering. The main thread
will perform all rendering when set to 
.I 0. 
Having one or more threads doing rendering can produce smoother
graphic updates especially when using client-side rendering.
Default value is
.I 1.
Option '--threads' will override this setting.

.TP
.B renderingThreadPriority:     Integer
Priority of rendering threads. From -20 to 20, 20 being lowest priority
and -20 being real time priority. For most systems only priority values 
higher than the priority of the main thread is allowed. Default the 
priority is inherited from main thread.
Option '--thread-priority' will override this setting.

.P
When running waimea on display with multiple screens the screen0 key in
the following configuration options can also be screen1, 2 etc. for any 
appropriate screen.

.TP
.B screen0.actionFile:     Filepath

.I 3x3
will set the virtual desktop size to three times screen height 
in virtual height and three times screen width in virtual width.
Default value is 
.I 3x3.
Option '--virtual-size' will override this setting.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Waimea configuration files are in XML format. They can be read from
files and output of executables. When waimea starts it reads three 
configuration files, 'actionFile', 'styleFile' and 'menuFile'. 
It's possible to read additional configuration files while waimea
is running by using the action functions provided or by sending 
configuration file data from another X client to waimea.

.P
For the current format of configuration files, see the 
Document Type Definition
.B @pkgdatadir@/waimea.dtd.
