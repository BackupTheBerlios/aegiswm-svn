Kahakai and Waimea are both considered distant descendants of aegis.  Kahakai,
because its development goals were the same as the goals that aegis has, and the
decision to write a new window manager came as a result of our development with
Kahakai.  Both Hyriand and Michael Brailsford were developers on the Kahakai wm.
Waimea, it was the predecesor of Kahakai, and is extremely configurable.
It inspired the development of Kahakai.

aewm++, aewm, and 9wm are considered ancestors of aegis because they all share
source/functionality.  If Waimea and Kahakai are distant relatives of aegis,
aewm* and 9wm are the parents and grandparents of aegis.  They are listed in
generational order.
